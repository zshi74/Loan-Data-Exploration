# Loan-Data-Exploration

In this data set, there is a target that we want to predict: does this person make more or less than $50,000 per year. This target is provided in the dataset and labeled as “income.” In this hypothetical, the rest of the columns are data that we have access to for consumers and in order to make a better lending decision we want to estimate the consumer’s income level.

More detailed, we want to know how these columns relate to income and what information do they contain that might help us make a prediction.

## Question 1:
Which race, sex combination is most represented in this data set? Which race, sex combination is least likely to make more than $50K?

## Question 2:
Are there any columns that can be dropped from this data set without damaging the information contained within the data?

## Question 3:
What steps did you take to prepare the data for your analysis and why did you need to do those steps? What tools did you use to do this data preparation and the associated analyses?

## Question 4:
The column “fnlwgt” is a continuous variable that has a complicated, interconnected definition. For this column is a higher value or a lower value more likely to predict high income?

## Question 5:
If we could only have access to one of the columns (not the target column) and still needed to make an income prediction, which column would you choose and why? What if you could have access to 3 columns?

## Question 6:
What level of education should you achieve if you want to have a better than 50% chance of making more than $50K (per this data set)?
